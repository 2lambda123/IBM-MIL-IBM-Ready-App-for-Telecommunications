# IBM Ready App for Telecommunications

### Overview

IBM Ready App for Telecommunications demonstrates a new genre of mobile service provider where plans are controlled by the end user and not limited to a few choices. These dynamic service providers are starting to emerge all around the world. The app empowers the customer to control their mobile voice, text, and data plan while empowering the service provider to provide the right offers at the right time.

Customers are able to view the status of their existing plans and usage. They are empowered to change and optimize their service, exactly matching their needs without the need to contact customer service. Additionally, the scenario enables customers to find access to the nearest Wi-Fi hotspot, owned and operated by their service provider.

The app demonstrates how Service Providers could deliver highly specialized, targeted offers to their customers. Perhaps the user needs more data to be able to watch that football match in HD or they need to find the nearest Wi-Fi hotspot to support a video conference for an upcoming online meeting. No matter the need, the IBM Ready App for Telecommunications demonstrates the next step in mobile service.
